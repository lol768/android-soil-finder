Soil Finder for Android
==================

GPS-based access to USDA-NRCS soil profile data. Idea from [SoilWeb](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=casoilresource.apps.soilweb) app. Took one look at it and decided to try to make a nicer one!

To-do:

 -   home/start screen (while waiting for GPS)
 -   catch no network errors
 -   Google Location Services in addition to GPS?
